# Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/
# Time Complexity: O(n) â€“ each index is pushed and popped at most once from the stack
# Space Complexity: O(n) â€“ for the output list and the stack

def dailyTemperatures(temperatures):
    """
    Approach:
        - Use a monotonic decreasing stack to track temperatures and their indices.
        - Traverse the list:
            - For each temperature, check if it's warmer than the temperature on top of the stack.
            - If it is, pop from the stack and record the number of days waited in the result list.
            - Continue this until the stack is empty or current temp is not warmer.
        - Push current temperature and index onto the stack.
        - Initialize result list with 0s as default for days that never get warmer.
