def minCapability(nums, k):
    """
    Approach:
        - The solution uses binary search on the range of possible values (from min(nums) to max(nums)).
        - A greedy approach is used to count how many houses can be robbed given a threshold `mid`
        (current binary search middle value)
    Steps:
        1. Set `left` as the smallest house value and `right` as the largest.
        2. Perform **binary search** on this range to find the minimum possible capability.
        3. For a given middle value `mid`, count how many non-adjacent houses can be robbed with values â‰¤ `mid`.
        4. If the count is at least `k`, search in the lower half (`right = mid`).
        5. Otherwise, search in the upper half (`left = mid + 1`).
        6. The final answer is stored in `left` when `left == right`.
