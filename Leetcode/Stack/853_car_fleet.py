# Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet
# Time Complexity: O(n log n) â€“ due to sorting by position
# Space Complexity: O(n) â€“ for storing times on the stack

def carFleet(target, position, speed):
    """
    Approach:
        - Pair up each car's position and speed, then sort them in descending order of position.
        - This ensures we evaluate cars from closest to the target backwards.
        - Compute the time each car takes to reach the target.
        - Use a stack to track the fleets:
            - If a car takes more time than the car ahead (i.e., stack top), it becomes a new fleet.
            - If it takes less or equal time, it will merge into the fleet ahead (no new fleet formed).
        - The stack size at the end represents the number of distinct car fleets.
