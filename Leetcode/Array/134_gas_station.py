def canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost):
    """
    Approach:
        - If total gas is less than total cost, it's impossible to complete the circuit. Return -1.
        - Traverse the gas stations while maintaining a running `total` of gas - cost.
        - If at any point this total becomes negative, reset the total and start the journey from the next station.
        - The idea is that the segment we skipped can never be the start of a successful journey.
        - The index `out` will eventually point to the correct start station if a solution exists.
