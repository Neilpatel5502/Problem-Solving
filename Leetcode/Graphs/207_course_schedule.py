# Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule

# Time Complexity: O(V + E)           # V = numCourses, E = len(prerequisites)
# Space Complexity: O(V + E)          # For graph, visited and cycle set

def canFinish(numCourses, prerequisites):
    """
    Approach:
        - Build a directed graph where each node represents a course.
        - Perform DFS to check for cycles.
        - Use a `cycle` set to track nodes in the current DFS path.
        - If a node is revisited while still in the DFS path, a cycle is detected.
        - Use a `visited` set to memoize nodes that are already confirmed to be acyclic.
        - If all nodes are checked without detecting a cycle, return True.
