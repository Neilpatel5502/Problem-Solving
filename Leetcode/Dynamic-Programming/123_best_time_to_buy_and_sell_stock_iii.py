def maxProfit_top_down(prices):
    """
    Approach:
        - Use recursion with memoization to try all possible decisions at each day.
        - At any day `i`, we can either buy, sell, or skip depending on our current state.
        - The `buy` flag tells if we are allowed to buy (True) or need to sell (False).
        - `cap` is the number of transactions (max 2) we can perform.
        - Base case: if we reach the end of the array or cap is 0, return 0.
        - Recurrence:
            - If we can buy:
                - Either buy the current stock and subtract its price, or skip.
            - If we need to sell:
                - Either sell and add the price, decreasing cap, or skip.

# Space Complexity: O(n * 2 * 3) = O(n), for the 3D DP table
def maxProfit_bottom_up(prices):
    """
    Approach:
        - Use bottom-up dynamic programming with tabulation.
        - Create a 3D DP table where:
            - `dp[i][buy][k]` represents the max profit from day `i` with:
                - `buy = 1` if we can buy, `0` if we need to sell
                - `k` remaining transactions
        - Initialize all dp values with 0 (base case: profit is 0 when day == n).
        - Iterate backwards through the days to fill the table:
            - If in buy state:
                - Choose to buy the stock or skip
            - If in sell state:
                - Choose to sell the stock or skip
        - Final answer is at dp[0][1][2] â€” start at day 0, in buy state, with 2 transactions allowed.
